1. In general, the linear model of average yearly temperatures has a better fit
than the linear model of temperatures taken on a single day, January 10.
The yearly model has a r squared value of .189 compared to the daily model
has a r squared value of .053.  The yearly model has a higher r squared value
because the data points are the mean of 365 (or 366 leap year) days which
minimizes the effect of outlier days that have an extreme temperature.
However, both graphs have a r squared value that is much closer to 0 than
1 which is due to noisiness caused by the variability of measuring a single day
in the case of the daily model and in the case of the yearly model, although better,
the data also has a significant degree of variability also due to a small sample size
(i.e. sampling the mean of 365 days is better than sampling 1 day but 365 is still not
a very large number).  Measuring a single day or a mean of 365 days allows for more variation from
1 year to the next(i.e. a unusually cold day may be sampled one year followed by an unusually warm day the next year). 
Lastly, the slopes for both models suggest that on average there is a long term trend
of increasing temperatures despite flucuations in those results from 1 year to the next.  The yearly model
also has a lower se over slope ratio which suggests that the upward trend which is seen in the yearly model is
less likely by chance than the daily model.  The yearly model appears to exihibit a slightly higher slope 
than the daily model and both models signal an upward trend in temperature over the years.

2. The linear model corresponding to the data accross multiple cities has a r squared value of .746 significantly higher 
than either of the models for temperatures of just New York City.  It is likely that the r squared value and overall fit of
the multi city model is better than the single city models because each data point is averaged from a larger data set and the data is collected from
multiple regions of the United States which I believe minimizes the effect that a single outlying weather pattern can have on 1 data point(i.e.
A heat wave accross the east coast might affect temperatures in New York but not the whole country at the same point in time, San Fransisco would
be unaffected by a heat wave in New York).  Overall, it is likely that collecting data from multiple cities rather than 1 city reduces variability of the data
and therefore nosiness.  The multiple city model also exhibits a lower se to slope ratio which should give us greater confidenence that the upward trend of the model 
(suggesting an overall trend of global warming) is not by chance compared with the upward trends of the single city models.  I believe that if 3 cities were used to
calculate the average than we would once again trend towards having noiser data, however, I anticipate that the distance between cities will likely have a more
profound effect on the variability of the data than the actual number of cities that the data is collected from.  That is to say 1,000 cities within a close
proximity to one another (e.g. the New England region) will produce data that is noisier than 100 cities confined to the east coast and the least noisy data would
be from 10 cities that were all located in different regions of the United States.
